    <ul>
      <li>**Usage Data:** We may use simple, privacy-focused analytics (e.g., counting page visits) to understand general traffic patterns, but this data is fully anonymized and cannot be linked to individual users. This helps us improve our service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
